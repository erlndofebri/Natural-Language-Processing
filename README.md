# Natural-Language-Processing
This repository consist of 3 NLP projects, those are spam classification, user review sentiment classification, and restaurant sentiment classification.

## Spam Classification
We tried to predict whether the SMS is belongs to Spam or Ham, we tried to test our model and resulted:

This text is HAM : <br>
['Hello, You are learning natural Language Processing'] <br>


This text is HAM : <br>
['Hope you are doing good and learning new things !'] <br>


This text is SPAM : <br>
['Congratulations, You won a lottery ticket worth $1 Million ! To claim call on 446677'] <br>


This text is SPAM : <br>
['You are the winner, Your Mobile number has been awarded as winner, get your rewards and claim via https:ajwad.com'] <br>


This text is SPAM : <br>
['Hey. I repeat, just text the word ok on your mobile phone and send to 123123'] <br>


This text is HAM : <br>
['How you doing? I hope you are pretty good conditions'] <br>

## Review Sentiment Classification
we trained our model and tried to test our model with a new sentences:

This text is Positive Sentiment : <br>
['That was fantastic food, I am so happy to be here!!!'] <br>

 
This text is Negative Sentiment : <br>
['Soggy and too salty!'] <br>


This text is Negative Sentiment : <br>
['Too expensive, not worth for the price'] <br>


This text is Negative Sentiment : <br>
['Bad Services! We will not be going back to your restaurant!!'] <br>


This text is Positive Sentiment : <br>
['I will be back many times soon, your food is really good and Prices were good'] <br>


This text is Positive Sentiment : <br>
['Hot Ramen Level 5 is so good, it was really amazing'] <br>
